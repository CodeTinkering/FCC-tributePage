        <h2>1930</h2>
        <p>Armstrong was born on August 5, 1930, near Wapakoneta, Ohio to Stephen Koenig Armstrong and Viola Louise née
          Engel. He was of German, Scottish, and Scots-Irish ancestry, and had a younger sister, June, and a younger
          brother, Dean.</p>

        <h2>1936</h2>
        <p>When he was five or six, he experienced his first airplane flight in Warren, Ohio when he and his father took
          a ride in a Ford Trimotor, also known as the "Tin Goose".</p>

        <h2>1946</h2>
        <p>His father's last move was in 1944, back to Wapakoneta. Armstrong attended Blume High School and took flying
          lessons at the grassy Wapakoneta airfield. He earned a student flight certificate on his sixteenth birthday,
          then soloed in August, all before he had a driver license.</p>

        <h2>1952</h2>
        <p>Following his graduation from Purdue, Armstrong became an experimental research test pilot. He applied at the
          National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) High-Speed Flight Station at Edwards Air Force Base. NACA
          had no open positions, and forwarded his application to the Lewis Flight Propulsion Laboratory in Cleveland,
          where Armstrong made his first test flight on March 1, 1955. Armstrong's stint at Cleveland lasted only a
          couple of months before a position at the High-Speed Flight Station became available, and he reported for work
          there on July 11, 1955.</p>

        <h2>1962</h2>
        <p>NASA's Director of Flight Crew Operations, Deke Slayton, called Armstrong on September 13, 1962, and asked
          whether he would be interested in joining the NASA Astronaut Corps as part of what the press dubbed "the New
          Nine"; without hesitation, Armstrong said yes. The selections were kept secret until three days later,
          although newspaper reports had circulated since earlier that year that he would be selected as the "first
          civilian astronaut". Armstrong was one of two civilian pilots selected for this group</p>

        <h2>1966</h2>
        <p>Armstrong became the first American civilian in space on March 16, 1966 (Valentina Tereshkova of the Soviet
          Union had become the first civilian—and first woman—nearly three years earlier aboard Vostok 6 when it
          launched on June 16, 1963.</p>

        <h2>1969</h2>
        <p>The flight plan called for a crew rest period before leaving the module, but Armstrong asked for this be
          moved to earlier in the evening, Houston time. When he and Aldrin were ready to go outside, Eagle was
          depressurized, the hatch was opened, and Armstrong made his way down the ladder. At the bottom of the ladder
          Armstrong said, "I'm going to step off the LM [lunar module] now". He turned and set his left boot on the
          lunar surface at 02:56 UTC July 21, 1969, then said, "That's one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for
          mankind." The exact timing of Armstrong's first step on the Moon is unclear.</p>

        <h2>1971</h2>
        <p>Shortly after Apollo 11, Armstrong announced that he did not plan to fly in space again. He was appointed
          Deputy Associate Administrator for Aeronautics for the Office of Advanced Research and Technology at ARPA,
          served in the position for a year, then resigned from it and NASA in 1971.</p>

        <h2>1986</h2>
        <p>In 1986, President Ronald Reagan asked Armstrong to join the Rogers Commission investigating the destruction
          of the Space Shuttle Challenger. Armstrong was made vice chairman of the commission, and held private
          interviews with contacts he had developed over the years to help determine the cause of the disaster. He
          helped limit the committee's recommendations to nine, believing that if there were too many, NASA would not
          act on them.</p>

        <h2>2012</h2>
        <p>Armstrong underwent bypass surgery on August 7, 2012, to relieve coronary artery disease. Although he was
          reportedly recovering well, he developed complications in the hospital and died on August 25, in Cincinnati,
          Ohio, aged 82. The White House released a statement in which President Obama described Armstrong as "among the
          greatest of American heroes—not just of his time, but of all time". It went on to say that Armstrong had
          carried the aspirations of the United States' citizens and had delivered "a moment of human achievement that
          will never be forgotten."</p>
